# Task Management System

This Task Management System is a console-based application written in C++. It was developed as part of an Introduction to Programming course and served as the first project for the course.

## Introduction
The Task Management System allows users to manage and track their tasks efficiently. It provides various functionalities, including adding tasks, setting task priorities, specifying deadlines, and marking tasks as completed. The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks effectively.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the system by providing a title, description, priority level, and deadline.
- **Set Priorities:** Each task can be assigned a priority level from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest priority.
- **Specify Deadlines:** Users can set deadlines for tasks by specifying the year, month, and day.
- **Track Task Status:** The system keeps track of the status of each task, indicating whether it is finished or not.
- **Sorting Tasks:** Tasks can be sorted based on their priority level, allowing users to view tasks in order of importance.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users have the option to delete tasks from the system.

## Getting Started
To run the Task Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sanoooavi/Planner.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Planner`
3. Compile the code: `g++ project.cpp `
4. Run the application: `./a.out`

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the following options to interact with the Task Management System:

- Press `1` to add a new task.
- Press `2` to view the list of tasks.
- Press `0` to exit the application.

Please note that this application is a console-based program and does not have a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and usability of the Task Management System. If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add your commit message'`
4. Push the changes to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Submit a pull request explaining your changes.


## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to the Introduction to Programming course for providing the opportunity to develop this Task Management System as my first project.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for learning C++ programming and building console-based applications.
